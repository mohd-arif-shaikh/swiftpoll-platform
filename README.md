## üìã Project Overview

SwiftPoll is a **multi-tenant, B2B SaaS platform** designed to handle massive real-time voting events with enterprise-grade reliability. Built for media companies and live event organizers who need to process **>50,000 votes per second** without system failure.

### Key Problem Solved
Existing polling solutions crash during traffic spikes, lose critical voting data, and are vulnerable to fraud. SwiftPoll provides a fraud-resistant, hyper-scalable backend that maintains **>99.95% uptime** during peak events.

### Performance Targets
- **Peak Ingestion:** 50,000+ votes/second
- **Event Volume:** 10M+ votes per hour
- **Uptime:** 99.95% during live events
- **Fraud Detection:** Real-time pattern analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Fraud Detection System

SwiftPoll implements a **"Flag, Don't Block"** philosophy with layered fraud detection:

### Layer 1: The Moat (New Account Spam)
- Detects accounts created within 60 seconds of voting
- Risk Signal: `NEW_ACCOUNT_SPAM`

### Layer 2: The High Wall (IP Velocity)
- Sliding window counters track votes per IP
- Threshold: >10 votes/minute triggers `VELOCITY_ATTACK`

### Layer 3: The Watchtowers (Geographic Jump)
- Detects impossible geographic movements
- Example: USA ‚Üí India in 5 seconds = `GEOGRAPHIC_JUMP`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (Confluent Cloud)
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Primary), Redis (Caching/Counters)
- **Authentication:** Spring Security with JWT
- **Stream Processing:** Apache Flink (Local), Spring Boot (Production)
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, WebSocket
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Deployment:** Render.com (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), Upstash (Redis)
